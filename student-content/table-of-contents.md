# GenCyber Camp @ Bellevue University & University Nebraska at Omaha
Files in this repository are intended to provide tutorials to teachers seeking to learn about cybersecurity first principles as part of the UNO Gencyber camp. The strategy is to *learn by doing*. The overall theme is to develop components of a web application with cybersecurity first principles *baked-in*.
