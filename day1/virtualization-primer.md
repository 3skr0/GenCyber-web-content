# Virtualization

### Cybersecurity First Principles
* __Domain Separation__: Good fences make good neighbors. When trying to secure a home or computer, separating the areas where resources are and people work prevents accidents and loss of data or private information. We are preventing the information worlds from colliding.

### Introduction

Virtualization is a technique to abstract computer resources like CPU, memory and input/output devices and share them among multiple __guest__ Operating Systems (OS). The guest OSes are managed by a __host__ OS. Each guest OS is completely unaware of other guest OSes and the shared nature of the underlying computer resources. Virtualization provides domain isolation between different guest OSes as well as between a guest and host OS. The guest OS is also referred to as a __virtual image__.

In this module we will, install virtualization software on a Windows host OS. Next, install a Ubuntu Linux guest OS. This setup will provide domain separation between our host OS and development environment. Any changes and/or "accidents" in the guest OS, stay contained within the virtual image. Thus, virtualization also allows safe experimentation with unknown software programs and malware samples.

#### Security tip
Do not to allow shared folders and storage volumes between virtual images. This prevents unintended data sharing between separated domains.
