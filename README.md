# GenCyber Camp @ The University of Nebraska at Omaha
Files in this repository are intended to provide step-by-step self paced tutorials to teachers seeking to learn about cybersecurity first principles as part of the UNO Gencyber camp. The strategy is to *learn by doing*. The overall theme is to develop components of a web application with cybersecurity first principles *baked-in*.

# Camp Study Guides
The guides are organized by camp days and are available at the linked urls:
