# Email Header Analysis

## Introduction

Email is an indispensable communication tool. We use it everyday. Unfortunately many attacks also originate in emails. Wouldn't it be great if everyone had some email super ninja skills!

It may come as a surprise that spoofing email addresses is the easiest thing a hacker can do! Turns out it is also most effective. Take a look at some of the statistics in the [Verizon Data Breach Reports](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/verizon-insights-lab/dbir/).

Here is an interesting one:
13% of people tested click on a phishing attachment; median time to click is very short.

If you are a bad guy, that is the easiest way for getting malware into an organization. So it is prudent to understand exactly where an email is “really” coming from before opening or clicking on it. By the end of this unit you be able to do just that.

## Email Headers

Email Headers hold a lot of information. In fact they have so much information that they are never displayed entirely to the user! The email reader only sees a few pieces of information out of this header. 

Before we get started, I would like to share my own personal accomplishment. A email from President Barack Obama.
